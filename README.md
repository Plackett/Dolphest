# Summary
A remake of Tempest planned to be written in javascript which will allow it to be run on any browser and will be dolphin-themed.

# Controls
A, D, <, >, for left and right movement across the lanes.

# Prerequisites
A browser compatible with HTML5.

# Offline Play
It is possible to play offline if you download the files and have them all in the same folder then open index.html.

# Online Play
Multiplayer could theoritically be possible but I do not see it coming in the near future, singleplayer online will be availible when I obtain a domain to host on.

# Credits
Plackett March 2021, if I took code from anybody I put their name at the top of the file.
